### Assumptions
This will only go as far back at Aug '21 at most (ergo two-factor tags are potentially valid for every ticket etc)

### todo
currently finding hard rules and looser regex, currently on reed accounts & access. pull up all tickets in both twatch and cus queue for that tag to understand it, also look at the criteria in the md file from the taylor writeup
  explicit rules AND regex stuff

when done, run against all currently tagged tickets and look at divergences

Instead of flagging to console.log, simply open in a new window with an alert message w the info??



If going back thru old tickets, do not modify affiliation!!!!!!!!! only mod old tix affiliation tag if there is no entry.


resolve when mult correct

look thru "TODO"s in the code

document everything clearly, go thru warnings etc, leave clear instructions on how to run for future CUS staff

make chrome+firefox extension which is a guesser and only active when ur on help.reed.edu (: (or nah idk)

ask if i can work on testing rt5? rt5 search is mouthwatering. look thru all rt5 related tix to familiarize myself first

config prettier
